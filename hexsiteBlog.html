<h2>10/25/2024</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp; i did a looot of research on SBCs and i went down the giant rabit hole. now ive reseached raspberry pi, orange pi, banana pi, le potato, turing pi, and than i descovered RISC-V. oh my god, even BIGER rabit hole. peach pi, milk-V duo, milk-V jupiter and mars, way too many things i forgot about.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; but even after all that reserch its still clear that ill probibly get a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/">rapberry pi zero 2 w</a>. if i get more moeny however, it would be (in order of price) <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus/">pi 3 a</a>, <a href="https://milkv.io/mars">milk-V mars</a>, <a href="https://milkv.io/jupiter">milk-V jupiter</a>. and more than that i would just build a cluster then something from parts. i would just ramble but i dont have time to write that.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; insted ill talk about somthing completely unrelated. i think sports bras are very cool. im quite autistic so ive always liked the idea of something that compresses your cest without hurting you. first i thought that wearing a bider for this purpose would make sence but i know better now. now just to find one with medium padding in a good size, buy it somehow, and never were it when my mom is home./hj<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; i feel like i could get away with it with the afformentioned autism excuse but i know it wouldnt work. ill probibly either write about computor stuff again or do some venting.

<h2>10/23/2024</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp; just made the website! hope i find out how to link this to the main one. i dont feel like doing anything else today. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
there is a few things to say though. i resently got a windows laptop from school (its online school) and its very helpfull that i have a compitant computor but there are a few things that are just rilly annoying.<br><br>
<li>i cant get games (understandable but i wanted to play dungen defenders 2 after first playing it a long time ago)</li>
<li>i cant accses the terminal</li><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
yea, thats right, i cant use the terminal, wich means i can do very much coding stuff because a bunch of ssd s need the terminal to download. i have come into contact with a very good programing language that im gona commit to learning, but i cant compile anything!. (this lets me run the programs)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
but, one thing that is happening is that i may in a few weeks get a mini computor, spesificly the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/">raspberry pi zero 2</a> wich i will be using as a note taker and codeing machine. its not very powerfull, so i cant do the afformentioned gameing, but it will be sooooo usefull. with it i will learn dart, flutter, and bash!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
if i do get a bigger computor, it will probibly be from weaker parts. and i do plan finding most of the stuff from old or broken laptops. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
if not that, ill save up monney to get a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/">pi5</a> and start a cluster so that i can incrementaly upgrade it. (and at three i will probibly get <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">mint os</a>) but this is unlikly. im in contact with somone who "makes computors" (i dont know that yet, my mom said this) so i might be able to have somone to help me, so thats good! <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
so, hopefully i get a new computor soon or somehow the school lets me use the terminal. in ither case there will still be something missing, wich is a shame, but you use what you have.
