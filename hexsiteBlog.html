<h2>10/23/2024</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp; just made the website! hope i find out how to link this to the main one. i dont feel like doing anything else today. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
there is a few things to say though. i resently got a windows laptop from school (its online school) and its very helpfull that i have a compitant computor but there are a few things that are just rilly annoying.<br><br>
<li>i cant get games (understandable but i wanted to play dungen defenders 2 after first playing it a long time ago)</li>
<li>i cant accses the terminal</li><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
yea, thats right, i cant use the terminal, wich means i can do very much coding stuff because a bunch of ssd s need the terminal to download. i have come into contact with a very good programing language that im gona commit to learning, but i cant compile anything!. (this lets me run the programs)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
but, one thing that is happening is that i may in a few weeks get a mini computor, spesificly the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/">raspberry pi zero 2</a> wich i will be using as a note taker and codeing machine. its not very powerfull, so i cant do the afformentioned gameing, but it will be sooooo usefull. with it i will learn dart, flutter, and bash!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
if i do get a bigger computor, it will probibly be from weaker parts. and i do plan finding most of the stuff from old or broken laptops. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
if not that, ill save up monney to get a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/">pi5</a> and start a cluster so that i can incrementaly upgrade it. (and at three i will probibly get <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">mint os</a>) but this is unlikly. im in contact with somone who "makes computors" (i dont know that yet, my mom said this) so i might be able to have somone to help me, so thats good! <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
so, hopefully i get a new computor soon or somehow the school lets me use the terminal. in ither case there will still be something missing, wich is a shame, but you use what you have.
